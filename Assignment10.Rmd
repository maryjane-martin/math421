***How to do it?***: 

- Open the Rmarkdown file of this assignment ([link](assignment10.Rmd)) in Rstudio. 

- Right under each **question**, insert  a code chunk (you can use the hotkey `Ctrl + Alt + I` to add a code chunk) and code the solution for the question. 

- `Knit` the rmarkdown file (hotkey: `Ctrl + Alt + K`) to export an html.  

-  Publish the html file to your Githiub Page. 

***Submission***: Submit the link on Github of the assignment to Canvas

-------

1. Use the `Adult Census Income` dataset.  We will predict the income (whether or not it is more than 50k or not) of an adult. Import the dataset.  Partition the data into 80% training and 20% testing.  
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
df <- read_csv('adult_census.csv')
```


```{r}
df <- df %>% 
  select(-education.num, -native.country, -relationship)
```

```{r}
df <- df %>% 
  rename(target = income)
```

```{r}
df <- df %>% 
  mutate(target = as.factor(target))
```

```{r}
library(caret)
set.seed(2020)
splitIndex <- createDataPartition(df$target, p = .70, 
                                  list = FALSE)
df_train <- df[ splitIndex,]
df_test <- df[-splitIndex,]
```

2. Practice Decision Tree.  Do the follows:

  - Use `rpart` package, create a decision tree with maximum depth of 3. 
```{r}
library(rpart)
tree_model <- rpart(target ~ ., data = df_train,
                 control = rpart.control(maxdepth = 3))
```

  
  - Calculate the accuracy of the model on the testing data. Notice that the positive outcome here is not `1` but `>50K` or `<50K`. 
  
```{r}
pred <- predict(tree_model, df_test, type = "class")

cm <- confusionMatrix(data = pred, reference = df_test$target, positive = ">50K")
cm$overall[1]
```
  
  - Plot the tree
```{r}
library(rattle)
fancyRpartPlot(tree_model)
```
  
  - Plot the variable importance by the tree
```{r}
tree_model$variable.importance

barplot(tree_model$variable.importance)
```
  
3. Create 3 more trees and compare the testing accuracy of these trees, which tree give the highest testing accuracy.
```{r}
tree_model2 <- rpart(target ~ ., data = df_train,
                 control = rpart.control(maxdepth = 4))
```

```{r}
pred <- predict(tree_model2, df_test, type = "class")

cm <- confusionMatrix(data = pred, reference = df_test$target, positive = ">50K")
cm$overall[1]
```

4. Practice Random Forest.  Do the follows: 

  - Use `randomForest` package, create a random forest of 1000 trees. 
```{r}
library(randomForest)
forest_model = randomForest(target ~ ., data=df_train, ntree = 1000)
```
  
  - Calculate the accuracy of the model on the testing data. 
```{r}
pred <- predict(forest_model, df_test, type = "class")

cm <- confusionMatrix(data = pred, reference = df_test$target, positive = ">50K")
cm$overall[1]
```
  
  - Plot the variable importance by the forest
```{r}
importance(forest_model)
```

5. Create 3 more forests and compare the testing accuracy of these forests, which forest give the highest testing accuracy.
```{r}
forest_model2 = randomForest(target ~ ., data=df_train, ntree = 4)
```

```{r}
pred <- predict(forest_model2, df_test, type = "class")

cm <- confusionMatrix(data = pred, reference = df_test$target, positive = ">50K")
cm$overall[1]
```

6. What is the best model (in term of testing accuracy) among all models (including trees and forests) you have trained?
```{r}
#caret
```
