***How to do it?***: 

- Open the Rmarkdown file of this assignment ([link](assignment4_extra_credits.Rmd)) in Rstudio. 

- Right under each **question**, insert  a code chunk (you can use the hotkey `Ctrl + Alt + I` to add a code chunk) and code the solution for the question. 

- Notice that if there is `eval=FALSE` in the first line of the code chunk, the chunk will not be execute.

- `Knit` the rmarkdown file (hotkey: `Ctrl + Alt + K`) to export an html.  

-  Publish the html file to your Githiub Page. 

***Submission***: Submit the link on Github of the assignment to Canvas. 

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(message = FALSE)
```

This assignment works with the [IMDB Top 1000 data](../data/imdb_top_1000.csv).  Find out more information about this data at [this link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harshitshankhdhar/imdb-dataset-of-top-1000-movies-and-tv-shows).  Import the data and answer the following questions. 

1. List all the names of the columns of the data
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
df <- read_csv('imdb_top_1000.csv')
```


2. Which movies have the highest money earned (Gross)?```
```{r}
df %>% 
  arrange(-Gross)
```

3. What is the lowest rating (IMDB_Rating)?  List five movies have this lowest rating.
```{r}
df %>% 
  arrange(IMDB_Rating)
```

4. Which year have the most number of movies released in the list?  What is the total of money earned on that year?
```{r}
df %>% 
  count(Released_Year) %>% 
  arrange(-n)
```

```{r}
df %>% 
  filter(Released_Year == 2014 ) %>% 
  group_by(Gross) %>%
  summary(df)
```


5. What is the total money earned per movies on average?
```{r}
df %>% 
  summarise(mean_gross = mean(Gross, na.rm=TRUE))
```

6. Calculate the average number of votes by year. Calculate the average number of votes of movies that have IMDB rating greater than 9.
```{r}
df %>% 
  group_by(Released_Year) %>% 
  summarise(votes = mean(No_of_Votes, na.rm = TRUE))
```

7. Calculate the average Meta score in 2020 of movies that have number of votes in the third quartile. 
```{r}
df %>% 
  filter(Released_Year == 2020 ) %>% 
  group_by('Meta_Score') %>%
  summary(df)

```

8. (Optional - Challenging). The current `Runtime` variable is not a numeric. Use the `str_remove` function to remove ` min` from the variables then use `as.numeric` to convert the variable to numeric. Calculate the average running time in the 2010s. Calculate the correlation between running time and rating (adding `use="complete.obs"` in the `cor` function to ignore the missing values).  
```{r}

```

9. We can use `select_if` to select columns satisfying a condition and use `summarise_if` to do calculation on columns satisfying a condition.  Try the follows to understand these functions. 

```{r,eval=FALSE}
# Select only character columns
df %>% select_if(is.character)

# Calculate the median of all numeric columns
df %>% summarise_if(is.numeric, mean, na.rm=TRUE)
```


10. Implement the follows functions or combos. Drawing a comment or summary from each calculation. The codes in this question should be different from the codes used in other questions.

- select
###select(C1, C2)
- filter
###filter(C4)
- mutate
###mutate(NewColumn = C5, C6)
- summarise
###summarise(MeanC6 = mean(C6))
- arrange
###arrange(C7)
- count
###count()
- count + arrange
###count(C8) %>% 
###arrange(desc(x))
- filter + count + arrange
###filter(C9) %>% 
###count(3) %>% 
###arrange(desc(x))
- group_by + summarise
###group_by(category) %>% 
###summarise(MeanC6 = mean(C6))
- filter + group_by + summarise
###filter(C9) %>% 
###group_by(category) %>% 
###summarise(MeanC6 = mean(C6))
- filter + group_by + summarise + arrange
###filter(C9) %>% 
###group_by(category) %>% 
###summarise(MeanC6 = mean(C6)) %>% 
###arrange(desc(x))
